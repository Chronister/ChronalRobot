ChronalRobot
============

Python module for the Willie IRC bot used in the Handmade Hero twitch chat.

All custom commands are defined in `handmade.py`. (For now) please refer to the docstrings and comments for more specific information on commands and functions.

The config options used by the bot are available in `config.cfg`. Please refer to the [Willie documentation](http://willie.dftba.net/) for where this file needs to be on locally deployed bots.

Also included in the repository is a light (read: very incomplete) shim of the willie framework for running tests.
